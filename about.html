                        <h3>From Pain to Purpose</h3>
                        <p>Our founder – a nursing student, personal trainer and nutrition coach – was given a second chance at life. Through years of chronic pain and emotional turmoil he discovered the healing power of movement, nutrition and mindset. The lessons learned became the foundation for Lifestyle&nbsp;RX: an integrative approach that recognizes the interplay between physical health, emotional wellbeing and spiritual growth.</p>
                        <p>His journey is a testament to resilience. It underscores our belief that every setback can catalyze transformation when paired with courage and community. Today, he channels his passion for service through his work as a personal care technician and his studies toward becoming a nurse practitioner. His vision extends far beyond personal training – it encompasses a global network of wellness centers devoted to educating and empowering people from all walks of life.</p>
